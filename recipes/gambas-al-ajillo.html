        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb large shrimp peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>10 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (start with less if you don't want it too spicy)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry or dry white wine</li>
            <li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the shrimp dry and season with kosher salt. Set aside for now.</li>
            <li>Heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. 
                Add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat up to 60 seconds or 
                until the garlic gains some color (be careful not to burn it).</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp and paprika. Cook briefly, tossing regularly, and watching that 
                the flesh turns opaque with a pearly pink color (about 3 minutes or so; this 
                will depend on the size of the shrimp). Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in sherry, lemon juice and parsley.</li>
            <li>Transfer the shrimp and sauce to a serving bowl. Serve with your favorite crusty bread.</li>
        </ol>
